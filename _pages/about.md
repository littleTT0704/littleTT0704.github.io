Hi! I’m Jiatai Li, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I’m pursuing a Master's degree in **Machine Learning**. I previously earned my Bachelor’s degree from CMU, majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Psychology**.

My [work experience](/cv/#work-experience) was mostly on software development, with a focus on creating projects that directly engage customers and users.
On the [research side](/cv/#selected-projects), I began exploring embodied agents and have since transitioned to studying Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

I grew up in Beijing, China, and spent most of my teenage years at RDFZ. In my free time, I enjoy programming, cooking, and watching animes.
