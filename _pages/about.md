Hi! I’m Jiatai Li, a Machine Learning Engineer working at **NVIDIA** in San Jose, CA. 
I previously studied at **Carnegie Mellon University**, where I earned a Master's degree in **Machine Learning** and a Bachelor’s degree in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Psychology**.

My [work experience](/cv/#work-experience) was mostly on software development, with a focus on creating projects that directly engage customers and users.
On the [research side](/cv/#selected-projects), I began exploring embodied agents and have since transitioned to studying Large Language Model (LLM) agents.

I grew up in Beijing, China, and spent most of my teenage years at RDFZ. In my free time, I enjoy programming, cooking, gaming, and watching animes.
