excerpt: 'We investigated age- and sex-related morphological changes in cerebral blood vessels using 7T Time-of-Flight MRI, finding that older women show greater increases in small vessel tortuosity compared to men, potentially contributing to elevated risks of cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer&apos;s disease in women.'

Our findings validated that morphological markers of cerebral blood vessels are sensitiveto aging. Small vessels in the brain are particularly vulnerable. Further, compared to men, older womenare at a higher risk for cerebral small vessel disease, which may contribute to elevated SVD-related ADrisk in women.
