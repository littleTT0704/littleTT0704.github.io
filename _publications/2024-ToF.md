excerpt: 'We utilized 7T Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF MRA) to analyze age-related changes in cerebral arterial diameter and tortuosity, finding that aging is associated with increased diameter in large vessels, decreased diameter and tortuosity in small vessels, and potential implications for cerebrovascular health in older adults.'

The observed age-related increase in large vessel diameter aligns with the gradual diameterincrease with age in central and peripheral (lower and upper limb) vessels (Mandal√† & Cipolla, 2021)(Thijssen et al., 2016). Vessel diameter dilation may reflect a compensatory enlargement (Polak et al.,1996), loss of elastic fibers (Fritze et al., 2012), reduced arterial storage capacity and compromisedcapability to attenuate pulse propagation with aging (Zeki Al Hazzouri & Yaffe, 2014). Age-relatedchange in large vessels is accompanied by morphologic changes in small vessels (Fig. 1b and 1c),supporting a link between large vessel damage and distal small vessel alterations in the brain. Changein diameter in small vessels is also accompanied by change in tortuosity. Thechallenge with the small vessels is that their conspicuity is conflated by lower blood flow velocity. Age-related decrease in tortuosity may be a reflection of lower velocity in the small tortuous vessels.
